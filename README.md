** Building AI Products with Open AI!**

In this three-week course you’ll explore the fundamentals of generative AI models and hands‑on methods. 
- **Week 1** covers Large Language Models (LLMs), ChatGPT, text‑generation strategies and prompt design.
- **Week 2** dives into image generation—with autoencoders, GANs and diffusion models.
- **Week 3** addresses production AI workflows, common challenges, product design, safety considerations and the LangChain framework.

You’ll gain practical skills in reverse‑engineering model behavior, crafting effective prompts, selecting appropriate architectures and evaluating outputs for both text and images. By building end‑to‑end pipelines and learning deployment strategies, you can rapidly prototype and scale reliable, fair and secure GenAI applications—ready to lead innovative projects and drive tangible impact in any professional environment.
