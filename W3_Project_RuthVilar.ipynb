It is an area of active research and each application will measure the quality of response in their own unique way. An emerging way of measuring the output quality of an LLM is by using the LLM itself (also known as self-check). They have proven to be reasonably good at judging or comparing the quality especially when using a more capable model (e.g. GPT-4).

What is the best way to compare the two documentation strings to match with our accuracy criteria - like accuracy and easy to understand. There is no right answer to this question. As a simple measure, we can pick the `cosine_distance` by embedding both in an embedding space. This is the default options when choosing the langchain evaluator but it can be adjusted to suit our use-case.
